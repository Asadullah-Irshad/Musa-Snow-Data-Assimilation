## Abstract

Accurate forecasting of renewable energy consumption is essential for energy policy planning, infrastructure investment, and monitoring the global energy transition. This study presents a rigorous comparative benchmarking of four forecasting approaches — **ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM, and Transformer** — applied to annual renewable energy consumption data from the World Bank (`EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS`, 1960–2020) across 11 aggregate regions and income groups. Each model undergoes automated hyperparameter optimisation, and predictive accuracy is evaluated on a held-out test period (2016–2020) using RMSE. Deep learning models outperform classical baselines: **LSTM achieves the best test RMSE (0.7286)**, followed by Transformer (0.8938), ARIMA (1.2294), and XGBoost (1.2518). The champion LSTM model is retrained per region to generate 20-year forecasts (2021–2040).

## What the study shows

**The World renewable share is non-stationary, with a sharp late-period acceleration.** It sits near 16.7% for decades, dips through the 2000s, then climbs steeply to 19.7% by 2020.

**A seasonal-trend decomposition** separates the long-run trend from residual structure in the World series.

**The autocorrelation structure** (ACF / PACF) motivates the ARIMA specification and confirms strong persistence.

## Data

World Bank indicator **EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS** (Renewable energy consumption, % of total final energy consumption), 1960–2020, for 11 aggregate regions and income groups. Download from the [World Bank data portal](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS) and place it in `Data/` (see `Data/README.md`).

> The notebook loads the dataset from the `FILEPATH` variable near the top — update it to point to your downloaded World Bank file before running.

## Usage

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download the World Bank dataset and update FILEPATH in the notebook

# 3. Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook forecasting_benchmark_v2_1.ipynb
```

Deep-learning training uses PyTorch with hardware acceleration via Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) when available, falling back to CUDA or CPU.
